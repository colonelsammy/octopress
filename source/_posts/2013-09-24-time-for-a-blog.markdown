For some time now I've been planning to write a blog; I'd seen [Matt Gemmell's "Blogging with Octopress"](http://mattgemmell.com/2011/09/12/blogging-with-octopress/ "Matt Gemmell: Blogging with Octopress") and [his new site design](http://mattgemmell.com/2013/05/10/a-new-site-design/ "New site design"). As a geeky software developer, that looked like just what I wanted. The only problem was getting it installed and setup just how I wanted it; I don't yet have a Mac and I'd tried various Linux flavours without much success.

So I decided to try running it on Windows, and that led to a whole host of learning experiences involving Ruby, Windows and Native Gems that I'll blog about later...

Like Matt, I decided to [turn off comments](http://mattgemmell.com/2011/11/29/comments-off/ "comments off").  You can contact me [on twitter @ColonelSammy](http://twitter.com/colonelsammy "ColonelSammy @ twitter") or by email (mnoyes @ this domain).

This should come out right:
```c++
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
  std::cout << "Hellow world" << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Now to go and write something more interesting...
