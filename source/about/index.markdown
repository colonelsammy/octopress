Malcolm Noyes has worked as a software developer/author for several years; just how many can be deduced from the information that he started programming C++ using a Zortech compiler. He wrote several string classes before discovering the STL and several thread classes before multi-threading got standardised. He has never written a Unit Test framework but probably would have done if [Phil Nash hadn't got there first](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch "Catch main")!
